# Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Recommender System


## Problem StatementÂ¶
Aim of this exercise is to get initial insights of the online purchase dataset and recommend related products to user based on similar other users. 

We would be using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) algorithm for developing recommender system model. The process for developing recommender system using RBMs is highlighed here.

- Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: Initially we would clean and pre-process the dataset to make it ready for model training purpose.
- Model Functions: We would develop a few functions that would be useful in model training.
- Model Training: This step includes training the model with batches. It includes updating weights, hidden bias and visible bias parameters.
- Model testing: We would select one test case to illustrate model's performance on it.
